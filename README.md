# word-check

word-check is just a simple interface that checks whether or not a word is, well, a valid word. This was an opportunity to work with APIs, something that I have not done before. Hopefully, this functionality will be integrated into a future game that requires this kind of word checking.

Here are some GIFS of a demonstration of the interface:

### a valid word
![Testing the word "dinosaur"- valid](https://github.com/rac99/word-check/blob/main/src/gifs/wordcheck-valid.gif)


### an invalid word
![Testing the word "encapsulationed"- false](https://github.com/rac99/word-check/blob/main/src/gifs/wordcheck-false.gif)
